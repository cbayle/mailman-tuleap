Description: Mailman with Tuleap specific changes
 This package depends on mailman to get it installed but also diverts
 one of its files to change the behaviour for better Tuleap integration.
 .
 The main change is to accommodate the ForumMML plugin so that the external
 archiving that it configures doesn't disable the internal archiving made
 by Mailman.
